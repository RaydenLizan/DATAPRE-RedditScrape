several hundred blocks in any direction from the main island well what if like 7,000-10,000 blocks out in all directions from the main end island the sculk begins to spawn in small amounts but as you go further it gets more dense with the structures such as end cities and ships still spawning but being surrounded by more and more sculk the further from the main island you go with the further you go bigger sculk structures generating like giant veins\/tentacles bridging islands together with new mutated mobs like a shulker mutated by the sculk called a sculker that's blind as well and launches a levitation orb that doesn't last as long as a normal shulkers levitation orb and does darkness. The portals in the overworld lead to similar structures built in the outter sculk like 12000-13000 blocks out but the wardens spawn naturally in the sculk structures and don't require a shrieker to spawn\n\nNew biome in the end starting to minimally generate at 7,000-10,000 blocks out getting more dense you get out eventually bridging islands and taking over cities\n\nNew structures in the sculk begin generating 12,000-13,000 blocks out \n\nWardens spawn naturally in the new sculk structures\n\nNew version of shulkers spawn in the sculk called sculkers that shoot orbs that do darkness and mild levitation\n\nNew plant called sculk tentacles (version of the chorus plant) with fruit called sculk berries that teleport you shorter distance and give you darkness but if you cook it you get popped sculk berries that when brewed with a night vision potion it gives immunity to darkness and it makes you smell like the sculk providing immunity from the wardens smelling you\n\nTHE DISTANCES ARE UP FOR DEBATE I JUST WANTED TO BE GENEROUS BECAUSE OF HOW FAR APART CITIES CAN BE","6":"So, for context, I'm starting to study Geology, but just studying rocks is boring, so I am still mining fictional rocks to get dopamine on my brain.\n\nAnyway, I found an old graph (pre-1.14) to help me get more ores and I found out gold used to be found the most at Y=5. That got me interested, so I went digging for where gold is accumulated IRL.\n\nTurns out, Mojang got it really close, now.\n\nGold is found the most near rocks composed of volcanic ashes, tuffs. One thing to note though is that it's also surrounded by light-colored minerals...\n\nspecifically, quartz.\n\nNow, post 1.14, where do we find an ecossystem with tons of magmatic action, spewing lava and ashes everywhere, as well as tons of quartz and clumps of gold galore?\n\nThe Nether.\n\nI mean, Netherrack might as well be composed of ashes and now that we got the Basalt Deltas, there is ashes falling down everywhere, a great environment for gold formation.\n\nPlus, you could make the argument that at Y=5, there is tons of magma flowing and spilling, which can also excuse the abundance of gold there.\n\nThat's something I never saw coming.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStill doesn't excuse the fact iron ore is found pretty much evenly until Y=5 when it should be the most abundant material at Y=1.","9":"Hey everyone I just got the Craftee crafting dlc game for my son.

So players should be able to deal with the Warden *their own way.* Yet instead, the devs decided to give it 500 HP, no drops at all, give it a bunch of abilities, make it respawn immediately after dying, and reward you with only 5 xp after killing it. Killing the Enderdragon gives you **12,000 xp**, which is **2,400 times** the amount of xp that the Warden gives you, and the Warden is FAR more difficult to kill. \n\nThe Warden makes you feel helpless with maxed out enchanted netherite armor, and forces you to run like a p\\*ssy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeople argue that no one should complain about it because it's an intended game mechanic.

end is several hundred blocks in any direction from the main island well what if like 7 000 10 000 blocks out in all directions from the main end island the sculk begins to spawn in small amounts but as you go further it gets more dense with the structures such as end cities and ships still spawning but being surrounded by more and more sculk the further from the main island you go with the further you go bigger sculk structures generating like giant veins tentacles bridging islands together with new mutated mobs like a shulker mutated by the sculk called a sculker that s blind as well and launches a levitation orb that doesn t last as long as a normal shulkers levitation orb and does darkness  the portals in the overworld lead to similar structures built in the outter sculk like 12000 13000 blocks out but the wardens spawn naturally in the sculk structures and don t require a shrieker to spawn  new biome in the end starting to minimally generate at 7 000 10 000 blocks out getting more dense you get out eventually bridging islands and taking over cities  new structures in the sculk begin generating 12 000 13 000 blocks out   wardens spawn naturally in the new sculk structures  new version of shulkers spawn in the sculk called sculkers that shoot orbs that do darkness and mild levitation  new plant called sculk tentacles  version of the chorus plant  with fruit called sculk berries that teleport you shorter distance and give you darkness but if you cook it you get popped sculk berries that when brewed with a night vision potion it gives immunity to darkness and it makes you smell like the sculk providing immunity from the wardens smelling you  the distances are up for debate i just wanted to be generous because of how far apart cities can be","6":"so  for context  i m starting to study geology  but just studying rocks is boring  so i am still mining fictional rocks to get dopamine on my brain   anyway  i found an old graph  pre 1 14  to help me get more ores and i found out gold used to be found the most at y 5  that got me interested  so i went digging for where gold is accumulated irl   turns out  mojang got it really close  now   gold is found the most near rocks composed of volcanic ashes  tuffs  one thing to note though is that it s also surrounded by light colored minerals     specifically  quartz   now  post 1 14  where do we find an ecossystem with tons of magmatic action  spewing lava and ashes everywhere  as well as tons of quartz and clumps of gold galore   the nether   i mean  netherrack might as well be composed of ashes and now that we got the basalt deltas  there is ashes falling down everywhere  a great environment for gold formation   plus  you could make the argument that at y 5  there is tons of magma flowing and spilling  which can also excuse the abundance of gold there   that s something i never saw coming    amp  x200b   still doesn t excuse the fact iron ore is found pretty much evenly until y 5 when

respectively      they can take any number  followed by an m or a g      m means megabyte  g means gigabyte      for example  to set the maximum to 3gb   xmx3g     to set the minimum to 2 5gb

and sort it manually  and there s a lot of items to go through  i d like to automate it   i ve seen before that there are mechanisms with stacked hopper minecarts that can pick up a large amount of items quickly  and probably also begin to sort them  i m thinking about this because if i just put a couple hoppers in the floors where my piglins are  the sheer amount of items would be too much for a single regular hopper to pick up before most of them despawn  but i don t know what these item  vacuums  with minecarts are really called  so i can t look them up on youtube  i don t know what to search for  are there any good video tutorials explaining these mechanisms  that i could try to adapt to my situation here","236":"amp  x200b   https   preview redd it y53heaqske271 png width 1920 amp
